                            ----Reactive forms provide a model-driven approach to handling form 
                                inputs whose values change over time.
                                Reactive forms are built around observable streams, 
                                where form inputs and values are provided as streams of input values, which can be accessed synchronously.

                                import { ReactiveFormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

                                        @NgModule({
                                        imports: [
                                        // other imports ...
                                        ReactiveFormsModule
                                        ],
                                        })
                                        export class AppModule { }
                        Form Buider-
                                The FormBuilder provides syntactic sugar that shortens creating instances of a FormControl, 
                                FormGroup, or FormArray. It reduces the amount of boilerplate needed to build complex forms.
                        Validation -
